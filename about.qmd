Hi there! Welcome to my weblog. üëã <br>

I'm [Je Sian Keith Herman](#firstname). This is the place where I share my thoughts, tools, interests, projects, showcases, experiences, etc. I am currently a 4th year student at [Bicol University][BU] studying [Chemical Engineering][ChE] and unconfirmed impostor (sus).

I like coding and writing on the side[^1] when I have free time. My [blog](/blog.qmd) is one source where you can find most of my up-to-date written content.

On an unrelated note, I like iced tea üçπ, iced coffee ‚òï, and ice cream üç® in no particular order.

> If you're looking for what I am up to these days, check out my **[Now page](/p/now.qmd)**.
