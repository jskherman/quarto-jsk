{{< animate bounceInDown "Hi there! Welcome to my weblog. üëã" <duration=200ms> >}} <br>

I'm [Je Sian Keith Herman](#firstname) and I'm your average enjoyer of üç® ice cream, ‚òï iced coffee, and üçπ iced tea. This is the place where I share my thoughts, tools, interests, projects, showcases, experiences, etc. Check out the [blog](/blog.qmd) for some of it.

I'm currently a 4th year student at [Bicol University][BU] studying [Chemical Engineering][ChE]. I'm passionate about data, data visualization, and programming. I am a data-driven person and I love to find patterns and insights in data. I am also interested in creating visualizations to communicate my findings. I am a self-taught programmer (not quite there yet) and I enjoy creating programs to automate tasks and to make my work more efficient.

> If you're looking for what I am up to these days, check out my **[Now page](/p/now.qmd)**.
