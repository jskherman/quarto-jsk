  abstract = {Given the growing interest in retrieval practice among educators, it is valuable to know when retrieval practice does and does not improve student learning—particularly for educators who have limited classroom time and resources. In this literature review, we developed a narrow operational definition for “classroom research” compared to previous reviews of the literature. We screened nearly 2000 abstracts and systematically coded 50 experiments to establish a clearer picture of benefits from retrieval practice in real world educational settings. Our review yielded 49 effect sizes and a total n\,=\,5374, the majority of which (57\%) revealed medium or large benefits from retrieval practice. We found that retrieval practice improved learning for a variety of education levels, content areas, experimental designs, final test delays, retrieval and final test formats, and timing of retrieval practice and feedback; however, only 6\% of experiments were conducted in non-WEIRD countries. Based on our review of the literature, we make eight recommendations for future research and provide educators with a better understanding of the robust benefits of retrieval practice across a range of school and classroom settings.},

Distillation conditions were run at different distillation times, method of extraction (water distillation; Water and steam distillation), the number of trays. Interpretation of laboratory results was done through kinetic modeling and percent yield of elemi oil. Results showed that the distillation followed first order kinetics and the most effective way of distillation was water and steam with two layers giving a percent yield of 11.08 percent. The index of refraction, color, and density of the extracted elemi oil was determined to be 1.4764, light yellow, and 0.833 g/mL, respectively. The researchers designed and fabricated an essential oil distiller based on the laboratory findings. Efficiency of the distiller was tested set of trials with six different conditions. Results showed that air dried and uncomminuted resin with four trays in water and steam distillation gave the highest percent yield with 11.41 percent. The researchers concluded that, based on the findings, more trays give higher yield, ensuring a more intimate contact with the steam. Extraction time ranges from 1 to 1.5 hours. The computed rate of investment in the payback and the payback period are 326.481\% and 0.30 months respectively.},

Modern techniques allow scientists to discover the flavor secrets of sodas (i.e., the unique combinations of essential oils as flavorings) and to invent new formulations, although questions remain. For example, when a soda contains more than one citrus oil (e.g., lemon, lime, orange, neroli), how much of each is present? This is a challenge because each oil contains scores of aroma-active terpenes and terpenoids (the main molecular entities of essential oils that exist as a complex mixture of isomers) and thus are difficult to analyze. In addition, the quality control of essential oils in sodas is executed not by bottlers but by the makers of soda concentrates. Today's technology permits the production of tastier and safer sodas with concentrates made with select synthetic flavorings.},

  abstract = {At the Hanford Site, located in southeastern Washington state, nuclear production reactors were operated from 1944 to 1970. The handling and processing of radioactive nuclear fuels produced a large volume of low-level nuclear wastes, chemical wastes, and a combination of the two (mixed wastes). These materials have historically been packaged in US Department of Transportation (DOT) approved drums made from low-carbon steel, then handled in one of three ways: (A) Before 1970, the drums were buried in the dry desert soil. It was assumed that chemical and radionuclide mobility would be low and that the isolated, government-owned site would provide sufficient protection for employees and the public. (B) After 1970, the drums containing long-lived transuranic radionuclides were protected from premature failure by stacking them in an ordered array on an asphalt concrete pad in the bottom of a burial trench. The array was then covered with a large, 0.28-mm- (011-in.-) thick polyethylene tarp and the trench was backfilled with 1.3 m (4 ft) of soil cover. This burial method is referred to as soil-shielded burial . Other configurations were also employed but the soil-shielded burial method contains most of the transuranic drums. (C) Since 1987, US Department of Energy sites have complied with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) regulations. These regulations require mixed waste drums to be stored in RCRA compliant large metal sheds with provisions for monitoring. These sheds are provided with forced ventilation but are not heated or cooled.},

The objective of this study is to optimize the antioxidant components (based on antioxidant activity analysis) from the MCV leaves extract using Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) based on different temperature, pressure, and particle size via Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Besides that, it is also to evaluate the optimal condition of different extracting antioxidant activity from MCV leaves using Design Expert 10 software. The condition range for both pressure and temperature were between 150-350 bar and 30-70 °C with constant extraction time. The size of particle samples were between 63 μm-1000 μm. The antioxidant was analyzed using UV–vis Spectrophotometer (UV-vis). The lowest antioxidant activity was 8.20 \% and higher antioxidant activity was obtained at 49.76 \%. Lower absorbance indicated highest free radical scavenging activities. Maximum percentage (\%) indicated high scavenging activities, thus higher 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) is a good indication for antioxidant. The predicted RSM optimal condition of antioxidant activity was at temperature 50 °C, pressure 282 bar, and particle size 500 μm, which the predicted antioxidant was 50.62 \%. Upon verification through experiment, it was found out that the antioxidant activity value was close to the predicted value with an average error of less than 1\%.},

  abstract = {Recently, supercritical fluid CO2 extraction (SFE) has emerged as a promising and pervasive technology over conventional extraction techniques for various applications, especially for bioactive compounds extraction and environmental pollutants removal. In this context, temperature and pressure regulate the solvent density and thereby effects the yield, selectivity, and biological/therapeutic properties of the extracted components. However, the nature of plant matrices primarily determines the extraction mechanism based on either density or vapor pressure. The present review aims to cover the recent research and developments of SFE technique in the extraction of bioactive plant phytochemicals with high antioxidant, antibacterial, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory activities, influencing parameters, process conditions, the investigations for improving the yield and selectivity. In another portion of this review focuses on the ecotoxicology and toxic metal recovery applications. Nonpolar properties of Sc-CO2 create strong solvent strength via distinct intermolecular interaction forces with micro-pollutants and toxic metal complexes. This results in efficient removal of these contaminants and makes SFE technology as a superior alternative for conventional solvent-based treatment methods. Moreover, a compelling assessment on the therapeutic, functional, and solvent properties of SFE is rarely focused, and hence this review would add significant value to the SFE based research studies. Furthermore, we mention the limitations and potential of future perspectives related to SFE applications.},

  abstract = {Utilization of supercritical CO2 in safflower seed extraction was performed using a semi-batch extractor. Different extraction parameters, such as 40–60MPa pressure, 323–347K temperature, 20–76min time, and 1–3mL/min CO2 flow rate were applied. A two-stage experimental design application was performed in order to maximize the oil yield. First of all, a 32 factorial design was applied to estimate the effect of the main factors and their interactions. The second part of the experimental design was improved and accelerated using the steepest ascent method. Optimum extraction parameters were determined to be 50MPa pressure, 347K temperature and 76min time at a constant CO2 flow rate (3mL/min) according to the 22 design. Under these conditions, the oil yield obtained was 39.42\%, comparable with Soxhlet extraction (40\%) for 8h. Shrinking core and empirical kinetic models were applied in order to generalize the extraction process. The predicted data was compatible with the experimental data.},

  abstract = {Cichorium intybus L. or chicory plants are a natural source of health-promoting compounds in the form of supplements such as inulin, as well as other bioactive compounds such as sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). After inulin extraction, chicory roots are considered waste, with most SLs not being harnessed. We developed and optimized a new strategy for SL extraction that can contribute to the conversion of chicory root waste into valuable products to be used in human health-promoting applications. In our work, rich fractions of SLs were recovered from chicory roots using supercritical CO2. A response surface methodology was used to optimize the process parameters (pressure, temperature, flow rate, and co-solvent percentage) for the extraction performance. The best operating conditions were achieved at 350 bar, 40 °C, and 10\% EtOH as a co-solvent in a 15 g/min flow rate for 120 min. The extraction with supercritical CO2 revealed to be more selective for the SLs than the conventional solid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. In our work, 1.68\% mass and a 0.09\% sesquiterpenes yield extraction were obtained, including the recovery of two sesquiterpene lactones (8-deoxylactucin and 11β,13-dihydro-8-deoxylactucin), which, to the best of our knowledge, are not commercially available. A mixture of the abovementioned compounds were tested at different concentrations for their toxic profile and anti-inflammatory potential towards a human calcineurin/NFAT orthologue pathway in a yeast model, the calcineurin/Crz1 pathway. The SFE extract obtained, rich in SLs, yielded results of inhibition of 61.74 ± 6.87\% with 50 µg/mL, and the purified fraction containing 8-deoxylactucin and 11β,13-dihydro-8-deoxylactucin inhibited the activation of the reporter gene up to 53.38 ± 3.9\% at 10 µg/mL. The potential activity of the purified fraction was also validated by the ability to inhibit Crz1 nuclear translocation and accumulation. These results reveal a possible exploitable green technology to recover potential anti-inflammatory compounds from chicory roots waste after inulin extraction.},

  abstract = {Chrysopogon zizanioides, more commonly known as vetiver grass, is being used extensively for bioengineering in several countries, to stabilise soil. This species has a fast growth rate and can hold soil through its ability to grow on steep slopes. The use of vetiver grass for bioengineering has not yet been explored in the northern Philippines, an area prone to landslides owing to steep slopes, exacerbated by an intense rain fall regime and typhoons. The aim of this study was to validate the use of vetiver grass for stabilisation of an experimental landslide area in Atok, Benguet, northern Philippines, and to monitor its growth performance under nursery conditions. A nursery has been established in Atok for the propagation of vetiver grass and other plant species, with potential for use in stabilising landslides. Three sample plots were chosen randomly. The number of new shoots and shoot length were measured every month from planting. The results show that during the early stages of growth, vetiver grass was able to develop new shoots. The longest shoot increment measured in the nursery was 65 cm and the average number of new shoots was three per pot. During the rain season, the vetiver grass was transplanted to the experimental site. The transplanted vetiver plants were monitored there and, after 2 months, the plants had shown growth and were able to produce more and longer shoots. To assess the capability of the roots to stabilise the soil, a force gauge was used on three vetiver plants and other revegetation species, to measure how strongly the roots can hold soil. The results showed that vetiver grass has a strong soil-aggregation capacity and that the roots were able to establish in the landslide within 2 months.},

Accordingly, it is proposed that a situation be characterized by a set of template–behavior pairs, which is a set of personality descriptions (Q sorts) of hypothetical "ideal" persons, each one associated with a particular behavior. The Q-sort description of a particular individual is then matched against each template, and he or she is predicted to display the behavior associated with the most similar template. The heuristic and predictive utility of this template matching technique is demonstrated in 3 classical experimental settings: (a) the delay-of-gratification situation, (b) the mixed-motive game, and (c) the forced-compliance experiment. This technique can also be used to assess the ecological validity of laboratory experiments and to test competing theories of psychological phenomena.

Meanwhile, the global market demand keeps increasing until 3–5\%  per  year.  This  fact indicated  that  the  citronella  essential  oil business  was  having  a  high  chance  of  participating  in  the  global market.  This  study  aimed  to  analyze  the  citronella  essential  oil business  feasibility  as  a  “people-oriented-economy”  activity  and determine variables that affected the feasibility in implementing this business.  Citronella essential oil is produced by a steam distillation process with a production capacity of 2,400 kg/year. The number of citronella essential oil international product sales was reaching 76\% with  the  selling  price  of  IDR  360,000/kg  and  reaching  24\%  on  the local market with the selling price of IDR 180,000/kg, therefore the total of sales in 300 days/year was IDR 7,360,320,000. Based on this  calculation  the  total  of  profit  obtained  in  a year  was  IDR 99,463,383.

  abstract = {A total of 71 woody species belonging to 49 genera and 33 families are recorded along the  altitudinal range of 500-2200 meters above sea level on the northwestern side of Mt. Mayon, Bicol Peninsula, Albay, Philippines. Ethnobotanical uses are diverse ranging from being medicinal, food, timber, firewood, ornamental, sources of fibers, industrial compounds to being poisonous. Thirty-two percent of the species are endemics while the rest are indigenous showing greatest development in the Malesian phytogeographical region. Endemism is very high despite volcanic activity and extensive anthropogenic disturbances such as slash and burn farming and overharvesting of plant biota for sale to domestic tourists. There is an urgent need to determine the biochemical basis for the identified uses of Mt. Mayon plants as this may pave the way to drug  discovery and hence, economic development of the locality. An effective domestication program of Mt. Mayon plant biodiversity involving the surrounding local communities could be practical and convenient for everyone and favors protection of the entire Mt Mayon ecosystem and any other forests for that matter.},

  abstract = {Background: Vetiver is a key ingredient for the perfume industry nowadays. However, with the constant and rapid changes of personal tastes, this appeal could vanish and this sector could decline quite quickly. New dissemination paths need to be found to tap this valuable resource. Methods: In this way, its potential use in cosmetics either as an active ingredient per se (with cosmeceutical significance or presenting antimicrobial activity) has hence been explored in vitro. Results: In this contribution, we demonstrated that vetiver essential oil displays no particularly significant and innovative cosmetic potential value in formulations apart from its scent already largely exploited. However, evaluated against twenty bacterial strains and two Candida species using the in vitro microbroth dilution method, vetiver oil demonstrated notably some outstanding activities against Gram-positive strains and against one Candida glabrata strain. Conclusions: Based on these findings, vetiver essential oil appears to be an appropriate aspirant for the development of an antimicrobial agent for medicinal purposes and for the development of a cosmetic ingredient used for its scent and displaying antimicrobial activity as an added value.},

Gram-negative organisms are slightly less susceptible than gram-positive bacteria. A number of EO components has been identified as effective antibacterials, e.g. carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, having minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.05-5 microl ml(-1) in vitro. A higher concentration is needed to achieve the same effect in foods. Studies with fresh meat, meat products, fish, milk, dairy products, vegetables, fruit and cooked rice have shown that the concentration needed to achieve a significant antibacterial effect is around 0.5-20 microl g(-1) in foods and about 0.1-10 microl ml(-1) in solutions for washing fruit and vegetables. EOs comprise a large number of components and it is likely that their mode of action involves several targets in the bacterial cell. The hydrophobicity of EOs enables them to partition in the lipids of the cell membrane and mitochondria, rendering them permeable and leading to leakage of cell contents. Physical conditions that improve the action of EOs are low pH, low temperature and low oxygen levels. Synergism has been observed between carvacrol and its precursor p-cymene and between cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. Synergy between EO components and mild preservation methods has also been observed. Some EO components are legally registered flavourings in the EU and the USA. Undesirable organoleptic effects can be limited by careful selection of EOs according to the type of food.},

  abstract = {The economic potential of establishing smallholder citronella grass (Cymbopogon winterianus) plantation for essential oil production was assessed. Data were gathered through key informant interviews, field visits and observations of citronella plantation and processing activities of the University of the Philippines Laguna-Quezon Land Grant (UP-LQLG). The various activities involved in essential oil production include: site preparation (e.g. brushing and clearing, cultivation of soil, holing, planting, and fertilizing); maintenance and protection; harvesting and hauling; and, processing of citronella grass. By estimate, 96 L ha(-1) was produced per harvest which has a gross revenue of PhP115,200.00. With three harvests during the first year, the gross revenue was PhP 345,600.00. Considering all costs, the total net revenue of oil production during the first year of harvest was PhP135,562.20. Results also showed that pursuing such enterprise could be economically viable since its Net Present Value (NPV) in 10 years can reach as much as PhP2.891 M at 12\% discount rate. This can be translated to PhP240.917 NPV ha(-1). The projected internal rate of return for the same period is around 91\%, a fairly attractive return on investment The overall employment generation potential of the venture is also fairly attractive with an average of 936 MD ha(-1) yr(-1). One problem encountered that hindered the profitability of citronella production is that the UP-LQLG was not able to acquire an efficient extractor with which efficiency of oil extraction depends.}

SFE allows the processing of plant material at low temperatures, hence limiting thermal degradation, and avoids the use of toxic solvents. Although today SFE is mainly used for decaffeination of coffee and tea as well as production of hop extracts on a large scale, there is also a growing interest in this extraction method for other industrial applications operating at different scales. In this review we update the literature data on SFE technology, with particular reference to flavors and fragrance, by comparing traditional extraction techniques of some industrial medicinal and aromatic crops with SFE. Moreover, we describe the biological activity of SFE extracts by describing their insecticidal, acaricidal, antimycotic, antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antioxidant properties. Finally, we discuss the process modelling, mass-transfer mechanisms, kinetics parameters and thermodynamic by giving an overview of SFE potential in the flavors and fragrances arena.},

However, we found that oxychlorination did not occur in the presence of oxygen and, furthermore, that the gold acted as a poison/inhibitor during the initial reaction period, with the underlying reaction being ethene hydrochlorination. Supported Zn2+ was found to be a very effective catalyst for this reaction. The hydrochlorination of higher alkenes occurred, with high selectivity to a range of relatively complex chlorinated hydrocarbon products at rates of ca. 10–13 mol/(kgcat\,h).},

  abstract = {In this work, the thermodynamic data basis and equation of state (EOS) modeling necessary to simulate the fractionation of organic liquid products (OLP), a liquid reaction product obtained by thermal catalytic cracking of palm oil at 450 °C, 1.0 atmosphere, with 10\% (wt.) Na2CO3 as catalyst, in multistage countercurrent absorber/stripping columns using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) as solvent, with Aspen-HYSYS was systematically investigated. The chemical composition of OLP was used to predict the density (ρ), boiling temperature (Tb), critical temperature (Tc), critical pressure (Pc), critical volume (Vc), and acentric factor (ω) of all the compounds present in OLP by applying the group contribution methods of Marrero-Gani, Han-Peng, Marrero-Pardillo, Constantinou-Gani, Joback and Reid, and Vetere. The RK-Aspen EOS used as thermodynamic fluid package, applied to correlate the experimental phase equilibrium data of binary systems OLP-i/CO2 available in the literature. The group contribution methods selected based on the lowest relative average deviation by computing Tb, Tc, Pc, Vc, and ω. For n-alkanes, the method of Marrero-Gani selected for the prediction of Tc, Pc and Vc, and that of Han-Peng for ω. For alkenes, the method of Marrero-Gani selected for the prediction of Tb and Tc, Marrero-Pardillo for Pc and Vc, and Han-Peng for ω. For unsubstituted cyclic hydrocarbons, the method of Constantinou-Gani selected for the prediction of Tb, Marrero-Gani for Tc, Joback for Pc and Vc, and the undirected method of Vetere for ω. For substituted cyclic hydrocarbons, the method of Constantinou-Gani selected for the prediction of Tb and Pc, Marrero-Gani for Tc and Vc, and the undirected method of Vetere for ω. For aromatic hydrocarbon, the method of Joback selected for the prediction of Tb, Constantinou-Gani for Tc and Vc, Marrero-Gani for Pc, and the undirected method of Vetere for ω. The regressions show that RK-Aspen EOS was able to describe the experimental phase equilibrium data for all the binary pairs undecane-CO2, tetradecane-CO2, pentadecane-CO2, hexadecane-CO2, octadecane-CO2, palmitic acid-CO2, and oleic acid-CO2, showing average absolute deviation for the liquid phase (AADx) between 0.8\% and 1.25\% and average absolute deviation for the gaseous phase (AADy) between 0.01\% to 0.66\%.},

It was introduced by humans to the Americas, China, India and Africa for a variety of commercial purposes, including as an ornamental, a source of timber and for its fragrant perfume oils. Its use as a perfume oil have deemed it an important agroforestry species. Although not currently considered to be a high-risk invasive species, it is listed as invasive to many parts of the Pacific and is considered weedy in Central Africa and Pohnpei, and 'persistent' in Puerto Rico. It is also listed as a cultivation escape in Saint Lucia and Costa Rica. As it is pioneering in disturbed areas, a fast grower and can reach heights of up to 30 m tall, the species does possess invasive characteristics that could pose a negative environmental impact.},

External rewards were given to the experimental Ss during the 2nd period only, while the control Ss received no rewards.

  author = {De Jesus, Richard and Jose, John Vincent and Marfa, Mark Gabriel},
  institution = {{De La Salle University}},
  abstract = {Oil from microalgae is a potential large-scale feedstock for biodiesel production due to advantages over the common crop oil feedstock, especially in terms of land area use. The extraction of oil from microalgae using supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is gaining increased popularity due to its advantages over conventional solvent extraction, such as high yield of fatty acid methyl ester, or biodiesel, from the oil extracted. This research focused on optimizing extraction parameters in relation to oil yield from the microalga . The fatty acid profile of the oil was also obtained by transesterification of the oil extracted with SCCO2 and compared to the fatty acid profile obtained from in situ transesterification of the biomass. For the study, was cultivated and subjected to centrifugation and drying before the SCCO2 extraction, while a portion was used for in situ transesterification. The temperature, pressure and flow rate of CO2 and the amount of biomass was modified for the different runs using Taguchi design at 45-65°C, 15-25 MPa, and 10-20 mL/min., and the oil yield for each run was measured. The data was analyzed statistically to determine the optimum conditions for highest oil yield. The oils extracts were transesterified and analyzed using GC-FID for their fatty acid profiles and compared with established standards to determine the suitability of the microalga. The study found positive effects in relation to oil yield by increasing the temperature, pressure, and flow rate. The optimum conditions were found by the Taguchi method at 65 °C, 25 MPa, and 20 mL/min. resulting to an oil yield of 5.13\%, but lower than the best yield obtained of 5.62\% at 55 °C, 25 MPa, and 15 mL/min., suggesting interaction effects. Fatty acid profiles of SCCO2 extracts were mostly similar, with abundance of saturated fatty acids, with exception to a few runs, suggesting little effect of parameters on fatty acid profile, while in situ displayed more unsaturated fatty acids comparatively. Estimation of biodiesel properties showed favorable properties for the oil extracted except for its poor cold flow properties.},

  abstract = {Despite industrial application for almost four decades, there is reluctance in some world regions to adopt supercritical (sc) CO2 extraction because of the wrong perception that it is not fully competitive. To refute this misconception, this manuscript analyzes economics of scCO2 extraction of vegetable oil from prepressed seeds. Selection of this application was due to the availability of a predictive mathematical model of the extraction process applicable for simulation purposes; inner microstructural changes of oilseeds during prepressing allow their extraction according to a shrinking core hypothesis. The predictive model has as its single parameter a particle-size and scCO2-condition-independent microstructural mass transfer factor that can be best-fitted to laboratory extractions, existing literature correlations to estimate other model parameters, such as the axial dispersion in packed beds operating with supercritical fluids, and the solubility of vegetable oils in scCO2. On the other hand, there is a need to correlate literature data for the film mass transfer coefficient to unveil the factors responsible for experimental data scattering. Because laboratory or pilot plant runs in single-extraction-vessel units cannot produce the simulated countercurrent contact in an industrial plant having ≥3 extraction vessels, mathematical simulation provides the relationship between oil yield and extraction time that can anchor precise estimations of extraction cost. Analysis of results unveiled differences in optimal extraction time (for minimal extraction cost) between production costs estimated in this work and the operational costs informed before. Because the operational cost does not include the capital cost of the industrial plant, the need appears to reduce its contribution to the total cost by increasing plant productivity. This is achieved reducing extraction time, which negatively influences oil yield. To make further progress in the optimization of industrial scCO2 extraction processes, this manuscript proposes refining the mathematical simulation approach, and studying those technical constraints whose manifestations become more prevalent on scale-up. Mathematical simulation can be adapted to alternative, sample-pretreatment dependent mass transfer mechanisms in the solid matrix. It can be refined also to account for the size distribution of the substrate, radial changes in superficial scCO2 velocity, axial changes in pressure, and radial/axial changes in temperature resulting from heterogeneous packing, pressure drop, and/or heat transfer from/to extraction vessel walls that may influence large-scale extractions. Large-scale experiments will allow studying these phenomena, as well as technical constraints to the decrease in particle size, increase in scCO2 velocity, and decrease in extraction time imposed by the agglomeration and decrease in packed bed permeability of the substrate, and thermal effects during reconditioning of extraction vessels. The latter effects should be included as restrictions in the optimization of the extraction process, which may limit the extraction rate and the size or number of extraction vessel that impact economics positively. Close collaboration with industry will facilitate tackling large-scale problems, as well as refining estimates of plant cost as a function of its size and/or configuration.},

Ethanol addition was able to increase total yield up to 60\% within the 6h of extraction, reaching up to ηtotal=1.25 (wt.\%). For stigmasterol uptake, two yield plateaus were observed within the six runs: one at ηstigm=0.17 (wt.\%) for 0.0 (wt.\%) ethanol and the other at 0.23 (wt.\%) for 5.0 (wt.\%) ethanol, which suggests that the attainable practical amount of extractives depends on whether cosolvent is used or not. Simplified modeling disclosed that both intraparticle diffusion and film diffusion may be present in the SFE process. On the other hand, the broken plus intact cells (BIC) model of Sovová allowed to fit experimental data with deviations of 4.20\% for ηtotal and 4.02\% for ηstigm, and to get instructive insights on the process. In fact, BIC model evidenced the existence of a selectivity advantage favorable to stigmasterol that is driven by kinetics rather than by solubility, which is corroborated by the fact that shorter extraction periods were noticed in stigmasterol yield curves than in the global extract yield curves. In the whole, these results and insights support the realization of scale-up assays and provide a contribution for the valorization of water hyacinth through a green process devoted to the production of stigmasterol enriched extracts.},

Experiments were performed at various ranges of SCE parameters; temperature (303.15–368.15)K, pressure (15–35)MPa, solvent flow rate (5–25)g/min, particle size (0.2–1.4)mm and co-solvent (ethanol) flow rate as (0–20)\% of CO2 flow rate. Obtained oil was analyzed through gas chromatography to estimate fatty acid concentrations. Effects of SCE parameters were investigated on the extraction yield and oleic acid concentration of papaya seed oil through central composite design. Further, two mathematical models (PM-1 and PM-2) were developed based on desorption–diffusion–dissolution (PM-1) and broken and intact cell (PM-2) mechanisms. These models were validated with the experimental data of papaya seed oil and further compared with the existing models. PM-1 proposed an equilibrium relation while assuming saturation of solvent and solute at interphase, which was successfully validated with the experimental data in the AARD range from 0.40\% to 32.48\%. PM-2 reduced the three zones of extraction curves to two and better fitted the experimental data of papaya seed in the AARD range from 0.45\% to 35.62\%. Model parameters of PM-2 were optimized through genetic algorithm.},

We have incorporated the stress-LTP findings into our "temporal dynamics" model, which provides a framework for understanding the neurobiological basis of flashbulb and traumatic memories, as well as stress-induced amnesia. An important feature of the model is the idea that endogenous mechanisms of plasticity in the hippocampus and amygdala are rapidly activated for a relatively short period of time by a strong emotional learning experience. Following this activational period, both structures undergo a state in which the induction of new plasticity is suppressed, which facilitates the memory consolidation process. We further propose that with the onset of strong emotionality, the hippocampus rapidly shifts from a "configural/cognitive map" mode to a "flashbulb memory" mode, which underlies the long-lasting, but fragmented, nature of traumatic memories. Finally, we have speculated on the significance of stress-LTP interactions in the context of the Yerkes-Dodson Law, a well-cited, but misunderstood, century-old principle which states that the relationship between arousal and behavioral performance can be linear or curvilinear, depending on the difficulty of the task.},

  abstract = {Soy sauce is a fermented product, and its flavor is a complex mixture of individual senses which, in combination, create a strong palatable condiment for many Eastern and Western dishes. This Review focuses on our existing knowledge of the chemical compounds present in soy sauce and their potential relevance to the flavor profile. Taste is dominated by umami and salty sensations. Free amino acids, nucleotides, and small peptides are among the most important taste-active compounds. Aroma is characterized by caramel-like, floral, smoky, malty, and cooked potato-like odors. Aroma-active volatiles are chemically diverse including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, furanones, pyrazines, and S-compounds. The origin of all compounds relates to both the raw ingredients and starter cultures used as well as the parameters applied during production. We are only just starting to help develop innovative studies where we can combine different analytical platforms and chemometric analysis to link flavor attributes to chemical composition.},

The modules are interconnected through appropriate boundary conditions that establish continuity of mass, momentum, and energy. The present model significantly improves our previous modeling efforts by, among other features, including the gas compressor unit, extending the operation of the whole plant to nonisothermal conditions, and upgrading the packed column model for reflux mode operation. The SFE model was validated against experimental data for the fractionation of edible oil mixtures by supercritical carbon dioxide. Good agreement was obtained between experimental and predicted results; moreover, the model correctly predicts the trends with different operating and design parameters.},

  abstract = {In this paper is proposed a simultaneous pre-concentration procedure using cloud point extraction for the determination of copper and zinc in food samples employing sequential multi-element flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FS-FAAS). The reagent used is 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN) and the micellar phase is obtained using the non-ionic surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114) and centrifugation. The optimization step was performed using Box–Behnken design for three factors: solution pH, reagent concentration and buffer concentration. A multiple response function was established in order to get an experimental condition for simultaneous extraction of copper and zinc. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the method allows the determination of copper with a limit of detection (3σb/S, LOD) of 0.1μgL−1, precision expressed as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 2.1 and 1.3\% (N=10), for copper concentrations of 10 and 50μgL−1, respectively. Zinc is determined with a LOD of 0.15μgL−1 and precision as R.S.D. of 2.7 and 1.7\% for concentrations of 10 and 50μgL−1, respectively. The enhancement factors obtained were 36 and 32 for copper and zinc, respectively. The accuracy was assessed by analysis of certified reference materials, namely, SRM 1567a – Wheat Flour and SRM 8433 – Corn Bran from National Institute of Standards \& Technology and BCR 189-wholemeal flour from Institute of Reference Materials and Measurements. The method was applied to the determination of copper and zinc in oats, powdered chocolate, corn flour and wheat flour samples. The copper content in the samples analyzed varied from 1.14 to 3.28μgg−1 and zinc from 8.7 to 22.9μgg−1.},

The constants for 274 pure substances were determined by minimization in the sum of the squares of the relative deviation in liquid vapour pressure. For 69 chemical compounds, vapour pressures exist over the range from 1kPa to the critical pressure and an average absolute deviation in vapour pressure of 0.039\% was calculated. Using Antoine equation coefficients and initial guesses for a correlation in terms of the acentric factor, Wagner constants were estimated for substances with limited data within the range from (1 to 200)kPa. To validate the proposed methodology, vapour pressure predictions from 1kPa to the critical pressure were made for 52 substances using Wagner parameters estimated from limited data. A value of 0.27\% in average absolute deviation results for those substances. Finally the Waring criterion was applied to check the constants presented in this paper.},

We argue that in many settings, agents can also infer information from others’ response times (RT), which can increase efficiency. To investigate this, we conduct a standard information cascade experiment and find that RTs do contain information that is not revealed by choice outcomes alone. When RTs are observable, subjects extract this private information and are more likely to break from incorrect cascades. Our results suggest that in environments where RTs are publicly available, the information structure may be richer than previously thought. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, decision analysis.},

The influence of extraction pressure and temperature and cosolvent percentage on overall yield and volatile oil composition was studied. The supercritical extraction conditions were optimized using the 2007 crop; operating at 35.0MPa, 40°C and 5\% of ethanol as cosolvent, 2009 and 2011 crops were also tested. Supercritical fluid extract compositions and overall yields were compared with the extracts obtained by conventional extraction techniques such as hydrodistillation (HD) and organic solvent extraction (OSE). Four terpenoids (linalool, 1,8-cineole, β-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene oxide) were selected as target compounds and their content in the different extracts was monitored by gas chromatography. Linalool was selected as indicator of the plant adaptation to the commercial purposes. HD is the technique that provides the highest percentage of linalool in all the extracts, but showed always the lowest overall yields; whereas, SFE extracts provides a good balance between the overall yield and presence of the four target compounds.},

They were developed on the basis of a plate-like geometry of the particles and were tested experimentally using various bract pre-treatments, pressures, temperatures and solvent flow rates. The two particle phase derived models applied, the Single Plate model (SP model) and the Simple Single Plate model (SSP model), differ only by the allowance or not for a film coefficient (kf) and have as the only adjustable parameter the matrix diffusivity (Dm). The third model, the Fluid Phase/Simple Single Plate model (FP/SSP model), considers both the particle mass balance and a detailed description of the fluid mass balance. In addition to the matrix diffusivity the FP/SSP model may require the adjustment of the fraction of oil leached by the solvent during the pressurisation procedure (f0). All models gave a good fit to the experimental data though the FP/SSP model gave the best fit. However, the matrix diffusivities found correlated very poorly with the estimated diffusivity of essential oils in carbon dioxide (D12), which indicates a complex intraparticle transport.},

In the process using SC CO2 extraction in a Supercritical Fluid Extraction System (SFE), the temperature of extraction was varied from 35–50 0C, while the pressure applied was 9.1–11.1 MPa. The flow rate of CO2 to the reactor was maintained at 0.5 m3 h-1. Steam distillation was conducted using a standard bench scale setup. The extracts from both methods were analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the variations of the composition were reported. The study showed that better oil quality in terms of composition was produced from the air dried raw materials than from direct heat drying. The essential oil extracted from air dried lemongrass leaves by SFE process contained 94.4\% citral, 1.14\% myrcene and 0.5\% limonene, showing a composition similar to the reference standard. In contrast, the oil from the air dried lemongrass stems fell short in terms of purity. SFE was found to be a superior process than steam distillation, producing better quality essential oil containing 90\% Citral.},

Experimental results showed that the increases in the concentration of electrolytes allowed faster corrosion process. However, too high concentration of electrolytes has no further impacts on the corrosion profile due to the existence of the passivity phenomena on the surface of the material, preventing the material to get more corroded. Acidic (HCl) and salt (NaCl) electrolytes gave more impacts on the corrosion compared to the alkaline solution (i.e., NaOH and KOH) since the acidic and salt ions are able to destroy the formed passivation layer. The correlation of the corrosion rate and the mechanical properties was also presented, in which the increases in the corrosion rate were in line with the decreases in the mechanical properties (i.e., tensile and yield strength). During the corrosion, the atomic structure in the material received attacks from the electrolyte ions, making the structure inside the copper alloys to be less strong and easily fatigued. Understanding the corrosion process and mechanical properties is important for further applications of copper-related alloys in extreme and severe conditions.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of Cyperus articulatus L. (Priprioca). Before the experiments were performed, the raw material was cleaned, vacuum packed and maintained at −5°C. The moisture content of the material was determined using an oven with forced air circulation operating at 105°C. The material was then ground, and the mean diameter of the resulting particles was determined using a set of standard sieves. Extraction was performed at pressures of 100–300bar, temperatures of 40–50°C, and extraction times up to 240min using supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent. For each load, approximately 50g of Priprioca was packed into the extractor. According to the experimental results, the yields of extraction were significantly influenced by pressure and temperature. Additionally, this paper provides a mathematical model of the supercritical extraction of Priprioca. The employed mathematical model was based on the mass conservation law, which included two partial differential equations for the solute concentration in the solid and fluid phases. By applying a novel method, the distribution coefficient of the extract between supercritical fluid and solid phases was obtained using the criterion of equal fugacity at equilibrium. The model-predicted extraction yield was then compared with the corresponding experimental data. Additionally, the reasons for the deviations between the model and the experimental data under certain operational conditions are discussed.},

Design/methodology/approach – The authors use a narrative historical interpretation to analyze Dale Carnegie's book How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. Initially, two of the co‐authors independently identified passages mirroring each of the four PsyCap capacities, while in the final stage a consensus on the interpretation was reached with the remaining co‐authors. Findings – The components of the PsyCap construct resonate well with the prescriptions that Carnegie narrated and outlined in his best selling book How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this study should be interpreted with a recognition that an alternative critical approach to narrative analysis could have been conducted based on the narrative logic of social power structure. Originality/value – This paper is unique in placing an emphasis on the insights researchers and practitioners alike can gain by re‐evaluating the self‐help books from the past.},

One disadvantage is that reading comprehension is reduced when reading from an electronic device; the cause of this deficit in performance is unclear. In this study, we investigated the cause for comprehension decline when reading on a smartphone by simultaneously measuring respiration and brain activity during reading in 34 healthy individuals. We found that, compared to reading on a paper medium, reading on a smartphone elicits fewer sighs, promotes brain overactivity in the prefrontal cortex, and results in reduced comprehension. Furthermore, reading on a smartphone affected sigh frequency but not normal breathing, suggesting that normal breathing and sigh generation are mediated by pathways differentially influenced by the visual environment. A path analysis suggests that the interactive relationship between sigh inhibition and overactivity in the prefrontal cortex causes comprehension decline. These findings provide new insight into the respiration-mediated mechanisms of cognitive function.},

  abstract = {For the proper design of supercritical fluid extraction processes, it is essential to have a sound knowledge of the mass transfer mechanism of the extraction process and the appropriate mathematical representation. In this paper, the advances and applications of kinetic models for describing supercritical fluid extraction from various solid matrices have been presented. The theoretical models overviewed here include the hot ball diffusion, broken and intact cell, shrinking core and some relatively simple models. Mathematical representations of these models have been in detail interpreted as well as their assumptions, parameter identifications and application examples. Extraction process of the analyte solute from the solid matrix by means of supercritical fluid includes the dissolution of the analyte from the solid, the analyte diffusion in the matrix and its transport to the bulk supercritical fluid. Mechanisms involved in a mass transfer model are discussed in terms of external mass transfer resistance, internal mass transfer resistance, solute–solid interactions and axial dispersion. The correlations of the external mass transfer coefficient and axial dispersion coefficient with certain dimensionless numbers are also discussed. Among these models, the broken and intact cell model seems to be the most relevant mathematical model as it is able to provide realistic description of the plant material structure for better understanding the mass-transfer kinetics and thus it has been widely employed for modeling supercritical fluid extraction of natural matters.},

  abstract = {Benign recovery of carotenoids has been carried out on the calyx of Physalis alkekengi var. francheti by means of supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) extraction. The influences of extraction pressure, temperature and particle size on the time-dependent carotenoids yield are fully investigated and kinetically analyzed by using the hot-sphere model. The highest carotenoids yield recovered in 200\,min is 15.96\,mg/g raw sample, indicating that the calyx may be of great interest as valuable raw resources for the extraction of carotenoids. sThe SCCO2 extract has exhibited good antioxidant capacity as verified by radical-scavenging activity test results. The manufacturing cost (COM) for SCCO2 extraction of carotenoids from the calyx has been evaluated for scaling-up to the pilot plant at 40\,MPa and 50\,°C and a particle size of 0.114\,mm. The effects of extraction capacities, labor wages, CO2 price and calyx-purchasing cost on COM have been analyzed. When using a capacity of 2\,×\,500\,L and an extraction time of 60\,min, the estimated specific COM can be US\$ 687.96/t calyx or US\$ 65.27/kg carotenoids, respectively. These calculation results turn to suggest that SCCO2 extraction is economically feasible to produce carotenoids form the herbal calyces.},

Moreover, frangipani has shown many biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, analgesic, anticancer, and anthelmintic. The extent of each of these chemical constituents varies depending on the type of species or cultivars as well as cultivation conditions such as soil type, weather, irrigation, pruning, and other horticultural practices. More uses and applications of frangipani by-products are continuously added. Further research on maximizing frangipani leaf and flower harvesting and postharvest processing methods, especially in the developing world, are needed to be developed.},

In addition to its construction, a survey of cost was done to compare the cost of the homemade unit with that of commercial units. The equipment was validated using an extraction of annatto seeds’ oil, and the extraction and fractionation of fennel oil were used to validate the two separators; for both systems, the solvent was carbon dioxide. The chemical profiles of annatto and fennel extracts were assessed using thin layer chromatography; the images of the chromatographic plates were processed using the free ImageJ software. The cost survey showed that the homemade equipment has a very low cost (\textasciitilde US\$ 16,000) compared to commercial equipment. The extraction curves of annatto were similar to those obtained in the literature (yield of 3.8\% oil). The separators were validated, producing both a 2.5\% fraction of fennel seed extract rich in essential oils and another extract fraction composed mainly of oleoresins. The ImageJ software proved to be a low-cost tool for obtaining an initial evaluation of the chemical profile of the extracts.},

The substances are argon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, and n-pentane. The properties required for the calculation of viscosity with this relationship are the molecular weight, the critical constants, and the density of the substance at the temperature and pressure considered. Separate relationships were developed for hydrogen, ammonia, and water which do not follow the consistent behaviour of the other substances. Viscosity values for ethylene calculated with the generalized relationship compared favorably with the corresponding experimental values.},

The effects of various parameters such as pressure, temperature, percent of modifier (methanol) and extraction time, were investigated by a fractional factorial design (24-1) to determine the significant parameters and their interactions. The results showed that the pressure, temperature and percent of modifier are significant (p{$<$}0.05), but the extraction time was found to be insignificant. The response surface methodology (RSM), based on Box-Behnken design was employed to obtain the optimum conditions of the significant parameters (pressure, temperature and percent of modifier). The optimal conditions could be obtained at a pressure of 35.0MPa, temperature of 72.6°C, and 8.6\% (v/v) for methanol. The main extracted components using SFE were γ-Terpinene (35.5\%), Thymol (18.2\%) and Carvacrol (29.7\%).},

Three basic methods for NOx abatement are analysed: selective catalytic reduction (SCR), non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) and extended absorption. The positive and negative effects and the net effect from the NOx abatement are calculated. The following exergy-based indicators are used for comparing the energy efficiency and the environmental impact of different treatment processes as a result from pollutants removal: reduction of the exergy of the emissions from the whole process route (ammonia and nitric acid production units); exergy of the additional emissions, arising as a result of the treatment process; total net reduction of the exergy consumption, Cumulative Energy Consumption (CEnC) and Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC) of natural resources as a result of the waste flows treatment.},

  abstract = {In his New York Times bestseller Steal Like an Artist, Austin Kleon showed readers how to unlock their creativity by “stealing” from the community of other movers and shakers. Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey—getting known. Show Your Work! is about why generosity trumps genius. It’s about getting findable, about using the network instead of wasting time “networking.” It’s not self-promotion, it’s self-discovery—let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, Show Your Work! offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive. In chapters such as You Don’t Have to Be a Genius; Share Something Small Every Day; and Stick Around, Kleon creates a user’s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity— what he calls the “ecology of talent.” From broader life lessons about work (you can’t find your voice if you don’t use it) to the etiquette of sharing—and the dangers of oversharing—to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it’s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.},

The operating pressures were varied from 7.50 to 20MPa, the temperatures were varied from 30°C to 60°C, and the flow rates were varied from 0.5 to 4ml·min-1. The best extraction condition occurred at 10MPa, 40°C, and a flow rate of 2ml·min-1 for a 3g sample of A. paniculata ground-dried leaves. The measured extraction rate was found to be about 0.0174g of andrographolide per gram of andrographolide present in the leaves per hour of operation.

Inherent with the aforementioned conditions, the need in andrographolide as one of natural remedies isolated from the leaves of Andrographis paniculata also increases. In this work, supercritical fluid extraction employing CO2–ethanol mixture as solvent has shown its capability in extracting andrographolide from dried leaves of A. paniculata. The andrographolide yield largely increased when the ethanol concentration in the solvent mixtures was increased from 0 to 12.5 mol \%, but there was no significant increase in andrographolide yield as ethanol concentration was further increased. Although an enhancement of both temperature and pressure gave favorable effects on the yield of andrographolide, a crossover effect existed in this supercritical system causing no significant increase of andrographolide yield. The downflow mode performed the highest extraction efficiency compared to both upflow and horizontal-flow modes. Supercritical CO2–ethanol mixture containing 12.5 mol \% ethanol flowed at 2 mL/min according to downflow mode at 323 K and 15 MPa was found to be the most effective in extracting andrographolide. The integral desorption model satisfactory described the extraction profile as shown by its low average error of about 5\%.},

In the past decade, SFE has been applied successfully to the extraction of a variety of organic compounds from herbs and other plants. This review article presents the practical aspects of SFE applications in sample preparation, selection of modifiers, collection methods, on-line coupling techniques, means for avoiding mechanical problems, and approaches to optimization of SFE conditions. SFE can also be used to clean up pesticides from herb medicines. SFE processes can be modeled to acquire useful information for better understanding of the extraction, mechanisms and optimization of the extraction procedures. With increasing public interest in natural products, SFE may become a standard extraction technique for studying herbal, food and agricultural samples.},

Despite acknowledging biases in the examples, participants' decisions were very strongly influenced by them. People shown dropout founders were 55 percentage points more likely to bet on a dropout-founded company than people who were shown graduate founders. Most reported medium to high confidence in their bets, and many wrote causal explanations justifying their decision. In light of recent concerns about false information, our findings demonstrate how true but biased information can strongly alter beliefs and decisions.},

In order to define process equipment and operation conditions, a supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) plant to produce 336 kg/d (60t/season1)) sweet pepper oleoresin is presented. The plant was designed to operate at 40MPa extraction pressure, 40 °C extraction temperature, and 6MPa separation pressure using 10000Kg/h CO2 as solvent. A formal analysis was carried out in order to identify the most important hazards. It is obvious that the dangers arising from this plant have much to do with the nature of the substances being processed, the way they are treated in the plant, and their tendency to take part in chemical reactions under these conditions. The basic procedure involved was first to identify the main types and sources of hazards (possibility of releases, fires, explosions, and operation of high-pressure systems) and quantify the causes and effects. Standardized test methods were used for this. The work included representative tests such as Dow index and a detailed PROBIT analysis.},

The catalyst was prepared from multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (3-MPTMS) oxidized in hydrogen peroxide under supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). The carbon dioxide under supercritical condition with ethanol as cosolvent allows swift transportation and promotes uniform distribution of organosilane groups on randomly entangled and layered orientation of MWCNT. The catalyst was characterized by using Field emission scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive x-ray (FESEM-EDX), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and Time-of-Flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The catalytic activity of the catalyst was tested using a high free fatty acid (FFA)-containing Hibiscus cannabinus (kenaf) oil, and the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) products from simultaneous esterification and transesterification reactions were quantified. To compare with scCO2 method, an acid catalyst was also prepared using liquid chemical deposition that resulted in only 45.11\% biodiesel conversion. On the other hand, the optimum conversion of 93.10\% was obtained using a scCO2 synthesized catalyst at the following transesterification conditions: temperature~=~63~°C, methanol:oil ratio~=~14:1, 10~wt \% catalyst and time~=~240~min.},

This paper presents some results from a trial of allowing students access to notes, calculators, and any device connected to the internet, which occurred during a midterm in a second-year ordinary differential equations university course. This was generally well-received by the students and feedback informed a subsequent use of this approach in a mathematical reasoning course. I argue that this open-resource exam protocol affords the opportunity for less routine and possibly more conceptual engagement with mathematics.},

  abstract = {Bicol Region [Philippines] is the second economically depressed region of the country. Albay is one of its six provinces with high percentage of unemployment rate. This project basically aimed to develop products and by-products of pandan and lemongrass which both generate new technologies and provide income sources for Bicolanos, thereby respond to this major unemployment problem. Pandan and lemongrass are locally abundant in Region 5 [Bicol region]. Production of these plants could generate on estimated grass income of Php 270,000.00 per harvest if sold at Php 5.00 per kilogram of lemongrass stalks, and 108,000 kilograms of pandan if sold at Php 3.00 per kilogram could generate an estimated income of Php 324,000.00 per harvest. Moreover, pandan and lemongrass contains medicinal properties. They are both used as diuretic. Pandan is an anti-diabetic plant and leaves can treat skin diseases. Lemongrass is also a stimulant, promotes digestion, reduces fever, and relieves menstrual pain and nausea. It is on these social, economic, and health considerations that the researchers conducted this research. An experiment and descriptive-developmental methods of research was employed. Matured pandan and lemongrass were subjected to juice extraction producing a sixty-two percent (62\%) juice recovery for pandan samples and seventy-two percent (72\%) for lemongrass. The extracted juices were processed into a ready-to-drink and granulated herbal drinks. The meal waste was made into powdered food seasoning and flavorings. Several recipes were prepared seasoned and/or flavored with pandan. Lemongrass and its combination such as chicken braised with lemongrass, hamonadong pata flavored with pandan and lemongrass juice extract, puto [rice cakes]and cookies flavored with pandan juice extract. Italian pork chop and chicken liver seasoned with pandan and lemongrass combo juice extract and others. Results showed that the produced ready-to-drink and granulated herbal drinks from pandan, lemon grass and its combination, and the different prepared recipes were highly acceptable.},

  abstract = {The popularity of tea is increasing on the global aspect because of its role as a significant source of phenolic compounds in human diet. The objectives of this present study is to develop a supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction method suitable for extraction of phenolic compounds such as total phenolics, flavonoids and tannin from tea leaves at various extraction conditions such as extraction pressure (100–200~bar), temperature (40–60~°C) and co-solvent (ethanol) flow rate (1–3~g/min). Furthermore, the total antioxidant activity of the SC-CO2 tea leaves extracts was assessed using ABTS+ (2, 2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) method. Response surface methodology (RSM) combined with Box-Behnken design was used to investigate and optimize the process variables. The results showed that, extraction pressure and co-solvent flow rate have significant effect on the responses. From the experimental data, second order polynomial mathematical models were developed for each response with high coefficient of determination value (R2\,{$>$}\,0.95). An optimization study using Derringer’s desired function methodology was performed and the optimal conditions based on both individual and combinations of all independent variables (extraction pressure of 188~bar, temperature of 50~°C and co-solvent flow rate of 2.94~g/min) were determined with maximum total phenolic content of 131.24~mg GAE/100~ml, total flavonoid content of 194.60~mg QE/100~ml, total tannin content of 49.99~mg TAE/100~ml and totalantioxidant activity of 262.23~μMol TEAC/100~ml of extracts respectively with a overall desirability value of 0.983, which was confirmed through validation experiments.},

The orange peel waste (OPW) was studied as raw material to feed the biorefinery with the purpose of valorizing the residues produced by the orange juice factories in the Colombian context. After implementing the methodology, the results show how essential oil and biogas were the most profitable and reliable products to be obtained through the processing of OPW.In this case, it is demonstrated also, that the understanding of the biorefinery possibilities is higher when this design methodology is applied.},

A series of experiments were carried out, for 360 min, at 50°C and at different pressures: 90, 100, 110 and 120 bar. Extraction conditions were chosen to maximize citral content in the extract oil. The collected extracts were analysed by GC–MS and their composition was compared with that of the essential oil isolated by hydrodistillation and by steam distillation. At higher solvent density the extract aspect changes passing from a characteristic yellow essential oil to yellowish semi-solid mass because of the extraction of high molecular mass compounds. The optimum conditions for citral extraction were 90 bar and 50°C, at these conditions citral represent more than 68\% of the essential oil and the extraction yield was 0.65\% while the yield obtained from hydrodistillation was 0.43\% with a content of citral of 73\%.},

Those are the questions Bowen McCoy wanted readers to explore in this HBR Classic, first published in September-October 1983. In 1982, McCoy spent several months hiking through Nepal. Midway through the difficult trek, as he and several others were preparing to attain the highest point of their climb, they encountered the body of an Indian holy man, or sadhu. Wearing little clothing and shivering in the bitter cold, he was barely alive. McCoy and the other travelers – who included individuals from Japan, New Zealand, and Switzerland, as well as local Nepali guides and porters – immediately wrapped him in warm clothing and gave him food and drink. A few members of the group broke off to help move the sadhu down toward a village two days’ journey away, but they soon left him in order to continue their way up the slope. What happened to the sadhu? In his retrospective commentary, McCoy notes that he never learned the answer to that question. Instead, the sadhu’s story only raises more questions. On the Himalayan slope, a collection of individuals was unprepared for a sudden dilemma. They all “did their bit,” but the group was not organized enough to take ultimate responsibility for a life. How, asks McCoy in a broader context, do we prepare our organizations and institutions so they will respond appropriately to ethical crises?},

  abstract = {Ylang Ylang is an essential oil traditionally extracted from the flowers of the tree Canaga odorata. It is used both in high-class perfumes as well as in basic toiletries e.g. soaps and shampoos, the traditional means of extraction being by steam/hydrodistillation. The major objective of the work described in this paper was to evaluate the potential for using Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) with Carbon Dioxide, as an alternative to the traditional technique. A bench scale SFE Extractor equipment was used in the experimental programme, the results being compared with those from steam distillation and hydrodistillation. The SFE programme also incorporated a study on the effect of flower maturity. Extraction performance was based on yield of oil, and chemical composition using Gas Chromatography. Steam distillation tended to produce a product of the 'floral water' type, but hydrodistillation gave a clear oil with a yellow tinge, yields being up to 1.7\% by weight. SFE was carried out over a range of temperatures varying from 100 to 400 bar (temperature 45 0 C) and a range of temperatures varying from 35 0 C to 75 0 C (pressure 300 bar). These results showed yields generally to increase with pressure but with no significant temperature effect. Maximum yields were similar to those for hydrodistillation i.e. \textasciitilde{} 1.8\%. Application of mass transfer theory showed that the bulk of resistance to mass transfer was external with calculated mass transfer coefficients being \textasciitilde{} 1x10-6 m 3 m-2 s-1. The chemical analyses of the two types of oil products showed some differences, with the oil from hydrodistillation showing slightly more of the quality defining esters such as benzyl acetate and benzl benzoate. The SFE products however showed relatively high percentages of eugenols (\textasciitilde 24\%). It is concluded that there is potential for the use of SFE technology in producing ylang ylang oils.},

In The Upside of Stress, McGonigal highlights new research indicating that stress can, in fact, make us stronger, smarter, and happier—if we learn how to embrace it. ~ The Upside of Stress is the first book to bring together cutting-edge discoveries on the correlation between resilience—the human capacity for stress-related growth—and mind-set, the power of beliefs to shape reality. As she did in The Willpower Instinct, McGonigal combines science, stories, and exercises into an engaging and practical book that is both entertaining and life-changing, showing you:~~~•~ how to cultivate a mind-set to embrace stress ~~~•~ how stress can provide focus and energy ~~~•~ how stress can help people connect and strengthen close relationships ~~~•~ why your brain is built to learn from stress, and how to increase its ability to learn from challenging experiences  ~ McGonigal’s TED talk on the subject has already received more than 7 million views. Her message resonates with people who know they can’t eliminate the stress in their lives and want to learn to take advantage of it.

In fact, our true interest was in determining whether subjects would return to the spatial reasoning task once the hemispheric recordings were completed. Subjects would normally be expected to return to the task by virtue of the Zeigarnik effect because no subject completed the task during the “hemispheric recording” phase. The manipulation involved telling one group of subjects that they would be paid \$1.50 for participating in the study (expected reward group). The remainder of the subjects were not led to expect the reward (unexpected reward group). The result was that 86\% of the unexpected reward subjects but only 58\% of the expected reward subjects (p {$<$} .05) manifested the Zeigarnik effect. This differential tendency to return to the task was further reflected in time differences. The average unexpected reward subject spent 3 min 48 sec of a five-minute free-choice period at the task, whereas the average expected reward subject spent only 2 min 20 sec (p {$<$} .05). Reward expectancy, therefore, led to an undermining of the Zeigarnik effect.

A great number of extraction processes are available. In this study, the recent processes were compared with the conventional ones. Also, the economic evaluation of the extraction process plant including energy cost, manual labor, raw materials, and fixed costs were studied. We assessed the costs involved in the extraction process of the bioactive compounds. Carbon dioxide is the most desirable solvent for Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE). Its attraction for the extraction of the heat-sensitive compounds is due to its critical temperature (304 °K). Solvent extraction and steam distillation process (SE‒SD) may overcome many disadvantages that conventional solvent extraction and hydrodistillation bring about in the extraction of essential oil. This combination technology has been used in the extraction of essential oil from plant material for high quality, simple technology, and low cost. The microwave assisted hydro-distillation (MAHD) is less tedious and minimizes the risk of the compound degradation at high temperatures. The MAHD presents distinct advantages for the fast and reproducible production process. The study of the ultrasound-enhanced subcritical water extraction process (USWE) showed many advantages such as: time-saving, environment-friendliness, and high efficiency.},

  abstract = {The adsorption method was used for fluoride removal from aqueous solution by Apatitic tricalcium phosphate. In this study, response surface methodology was employed for the removal of fluoride. Experiments were carried out as per Box–Behnken surface statistical design with four input parameters namely adsorbent dose (0.1–0.3g), initial concentration (30–60mgL−1), temperature (20–40°C) and pH (4–11). Contact time (90min) was taken as a fixed input parameter. Regression analysis showed good fit of the experimental data to the second-order polynomial model with coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.966 and Fisher F-value of 10.28. Applying the method of the desirability function, optimization of adsorbent dose (29g), initial concentration (60mgL−1), T (40°C) and pH (4) gave a maximum of 82.34\% fluoride removal white desirability of 0.916 by Apatitic tricalcium phosphate. Dynamic adsorption data were applied to pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order rate equations. Pseudo-second-order kinetic model well expressed fluoride adsorption onto Apatitic tricalcium phosphate. According to the correlation coefficients, the adsorption of fluoride on the Apatitic tricalcium phosphate was correlated well with the Langmuir and Freundlich models.},

However, studies examining effort-based decisions typically assume that the willingness to work is static. Here, we use computational modelling on two effort-based tasks, one behavioural and one during fMRI. We show that two hidden states of fatigue fluctuate on a moment-to-moment basis on different timescales but both reduce the willingness to exert effort for reward. The value of one state increases after effort but is ‘recoverable’ by rests, whereas a second ‘unrecoverable’ state gradually increases with work. The BOLD response in separate medial and lateral frontal sub-regions covaried with these states when making effort-based decisions, while a distinct fronto-striatal system integrated fatigue with value. These results provide a computational framework for understanding the brain mechanisms of persistence and momentary fatigue.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work was to study production costs for the supercritical CO2 extraction of a pre-pressed oilseed (packed bed with 2-mm particles) in a 2-m3 industrial multi-vessel plant operating at 40°C and 30MPa, using a fully predictive mass transfer model to simulate the process. We modified the inner diameter (47.3≤D≤65.6cm) and number (n=2, 3, or 4) of extraction vessels, and the mass flow rate of CO2 (Q=3000 or 6000kg/h), thus changing the aspect ratio of the extraction vessels (3≤L/D≤8), and superficial velocity (2.71≤U≤10.8mm/s) and specific mass flow rate (6≤q≤24kg/h per kg substrate) of CO2. Production cost decreased when increasing the mass flow rate of CO2 or the number of extraction vessels (or when increasing q). Production cost did not depend on the geometry of extraction vessel for a constant specific mass flow rate of CO2, but it decreased with a decreasing of the L/D ratio of the vessel for a constant superficial velocity of CO2. For any given plant, the contribution of fixed cost items (capital, labor) to the production cost increased with extraction time, unlike that of variable cost items (substrate, CO2, energy), which decreased. Thus, there was an optimal extraction time that minimized production cost for each plant. This work proposes an expression for capital cost of an industrial multi-vessel plant as a function of the mass flow rate of CO2 (which defines the cost of the solvent cycle of the plant), and the volume of the extraction vessels (which together with number of extraction vessels define the cost of extraction section of the plant), with a scaling factor of 0.48 for both items. Under optimal conditions, capital cost represented 30–40\% of the production cost, but uncertainties in capital cost estimates (about ±50\% using the proposed expression) may largely affect these estimates. The lowest production cost estimated in this work was USD 7.8/kg oil for the extraction of prepressed oilseed in a four-vessel plant using 6000kg/h of CO2. The mass flow rate of CO2 and number of extraction vessels also affected annual productivity that was about 360ton oil for the same plant operating 7200h per year. Oil yields were above 90\% for both three- and four-vessel plants.},

  abstract = {This work completes a series of three studies about the estimation of the cost of extracting vegetable oil from seeds using supercritical CO2. The focus of this work was determining the effect of extraction pressure (30, 50, and 70MPa) in the production cost of a supercritical CO2 extraction of a packed bed of 2-mm oilseeds in plants with two-extraction vessels with aspect ratio of 4.5, using a superficial velocity of 5mm/s. When extraction pressure increased while keeping other variables constant, production cost decreased. For 2×1m3 extraction plants, increasing extraction pressure from 30 to 50MPa decreased production cost 30.9\%, but when extraction pressure further increased from 50 to 70MPa production cost only decreased 9.9\%. Results suggest that the recommended extraction pressure for oilseed extraction is 50MPa. Also, this work compared plants operating at the three extraction pressures when annual productivity was kept constant (231, 456, or 596 ton of oil per year). The total extraction volume of the plant diminished as the extraction pressure increased. Optimum production cost in these cases was quite similar for plants operating at 30, 50, and 70MPa, but the total volume of the plant decreased 63.6\% when increasing extraction pressure from 30 to 50MPa for the plant producing 456 ton of oil per year, and an additional 31\% when increasing it from 50 to 70MPa. The lowest production cost estimated was 5.52 USD per kg of oil (optimum extraction time of 2.75h) in a 4×1m3 plant processing 2-mm prepressed oilseeds, and operating at 40°C and 50MPa. The manuscript includes a sensitivity analysis on production cost as a function of a variation of ±50\% of uncertain variables cost (respect to nominal values), which were considered as constant in our previous contributions. That cost items were unitary cost of annual labor, CO2, and substrate, being the variation of the last one the more significant effect on production cost.},

  abstract = {The companion book to COURSERA®'s wildly popular massive open online course "Learning How to Learn"Whether you are a student struggling to fulfill a math or science requirement, or you are embarking on a career change that requires a new skill set, A Mind for Numbers offers the tools you need to get a better grasp of that intimidating material. Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options—both to rise in the military and to explore other careers—she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life. ~ In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectively—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and science, but to any subject in which we struggle. We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first, and learning them does not have to be as painful as we might think.},

The oxychlorination performance of the CuCl2-KCl/Al2O3 catalyst deteriorated gradually, which could seriously affect stable operation. To clarify such deactivation factors, the relationship between catalyst performance and physicochemical property change was investigated using X-ray fluorescence, electron probe microanalysis, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements. Sublimation of the CuCl component and subsequent increment of the ratio of K to Cu components were observed at the inlet of the catalyst bed, and were determined to be contributing factors in the deactivation of the CuCl2-KCl/Al2O3 catalyst.},

We elicit subjects’ (naturally biased) beliefs about their relative performance in an intelligence quotient (IQ) test and allow them to update these beliefs in real time. Part of the way through the task we give each subject access to the beliefs of a counterpart who performed similarly on the test and allow them both to observe the evolution of one another’s beliefs. We find that subjects respond to one another’s beliefs in a highly asymmetric way, causing a severe amplification of subjects’ initial bias. We find no such patterns in response to objective public signals or in control treatments without social exchange or scope for motivated beliefs. We also provide evidence that the pattern is difficult to reconcile with Bayesianism and standard versions of confirmation bias. Overall, our results suggest that bias amplification is likely driven by “motivated assignment of accuracy” to others’ beliefs: subjects selectively attribute higher informational value to social signals that reinforce their motivation.},

The system was operated at atmospheric pressure, with a flow condensation rate of 4.5ml/min and a ratio plant/water of 1/10.Supercritical fluid extraction runs were carried out using a dynamic extraction unit at the operating conditions of 100 bars for the pressure, 40°C for the temperature and 7g/min for the solvent flow rate.In both methods the only parameter that was varied is the particle size, in order to investigate its effect on the processes.The obtained extraction yields were 2.5 and 1.94\% for the supercritical CO2 extraction and the hydrodistillation, respectively. The results confirmed that the particle size had an important effect on the two processes where a decrease of the diameter enhanced mass transfer leading to better extraction yields. However hydrodistillation took at least two hours less time than Supercritical CO2 extraction for a same essential oil extraction degree.},

Experiments were performed within expanded Box-Behnken experimental design on three levels and three variables. Influence of pressure (100–300bar), temperature (40–60°C) and CO2 flow rate (0.2–0.4kg/h) on total extraction yield was determined. In order to determine initial slope, extraction curves were fitted with five modified empirical models. Since Sovová model provided the best accordance with experimental data, initial slope obtained by this model was used as response variable for optimization with ANN and multivariable models (linear, exponential, logarithmic I and logarithmic II). Optimized SFE parameters for maximized initial slope were pressure of 283bar, temperature of 60°C and CO2 flow rate of 0.4kg/h.},

The plant samples were air dried and weighed and then transferred to the designed solar essential oil extractor. The rate of extraction was measured in terms of the volume of plant extract per day expressed in ml/day and the percent yield was measured in terms of the ratio between volume of plant extracts and the mass of plant samples multiplied by 100\%. Results showed that it is possible to extract essential oil from plants using the sun as source of energy. The rate of extraction varies with the plant samples with oregano as the fastest (3.4 ml/day) and rose petals the slowest (1.8 ml/day). The essential oil extraction process can last for 9 days. The percent yield of plant extracts varies with the kind of plant samples with sambong (Conyza balsamifera Linn) having the highest percent yield (72\%) and rose petals (Rosa damascena) the lowest (18.5\%).},

Supercritical extraction of valerenic acid from Valeriana officianalis L. has been studied and simulated according to the significant operational parameters such as pressure, temperature, and dynamic extraction time. ANN, using multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, is employed to predict the amount of extracted VA versus the studied variables. Three tests, validation, and training data sets in three various scenarios are selected to predict the amount of extracted VA at dynamic time of extraction, working pressure, and temperature values. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been employed to train the MLP network. The model in first scenario has three neurons in one hidden layer, and the models associated with the second and the third scenarios have four neurons in one hidden layer. The determination coefficients are calculated as 0.971, 0.940, and 0.964 for the first, second, and the third scenarios, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MLP model in simulating this process using any of the scenarios, and accurate prediction of extraction yield has been revealed in different working conditions of pressure, temperature, and dynamic time of extraction.},

  abstract = {The present work is focused on the supercritical extraction and kinetic study of sunflower oil. The effect of operating parameters, namely pressure (20–40MPa), temperature (333–373K), solvent mass flow (0.83×10−4 to 2.50×10−4kg/s), particle size (0.50–1.00mm) and ethanol as co-solvent (0–10\%) have been studied by a set of experiments. The outcomes of work show, extraction yield increases with increasing pressure, solvent mass flow and co-solvent. The retrograde phenomenon is also observed between 333 and 353K. The experimental data have been used to simulate the broken and intact cell model and fitting parameters are optimized by the global optimization method. The model successfully fitted the experimental data at high pressure with lower particle size. Industrial relevance The sunflower seeds are a major source of good quality, high oleic acid, vegetable oil and Vitamin E. Hence, largely used in beauty care products, production of vegetable oil based fuel oil and lubricants. There are also many other applications of rich–oleic acid oils such as food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biodiesel production, and also as a feedstock for the oleo-chemical industry. In recent years, due to rigid environmental regulation and health concern, high pressure extraction of the vegetable oil with supercritical carbon dioxide has received considerable attention as a promising alternative to conventional solvent extraction and mechanical process. Hence, the present work is focused on extraction of seed oil by supercritical CO2. Moreover, for industrial application of supercritical fluid extraction, it is very important to study the kinetic model that gives large scale extraction curves with minimum error by using model fitting parameters with small scale experiment. There are large numbers of models based on different approach suggested by various researchers to fit experimental data of supercritical fluid extraction. Amongst them, the broken and intact cell model proposed by Sovova's (1994) is widely used to fit the experimental data of vegetable oil extraction. The broken and intact cell model has three fitting parameters and many authors have applied different optimization techniques to optimize these fitting parameters. Therefore, in the present work the optimized kinetic parameters of Sovová's model for sunflower oil extraction are obtained by applying the Box complex optimization method to study the influence of pressure, temperature, particle size, co-solvent and solvent flow rate of extraction yield.},

This study discusses the extraction of essential oils and the parameters which control the process of mass transfer. The model presented here considers both intra-particle resistance and external film resistance to mass transfer and partial differential equations for unsteady-state mass balance for solute in both solid \& supercritical phases are developed based on the concept proposed by Melreles et al. (2009) and solved numerically based on a linear equilibrium relationship. The intra-particle diffusion coefficient and equilibrium constant are used as adjustable parameters for Basil \& Rosemary leaves and Vetiver roots respectively. The adjustable parameter is optimized by Golden Section Method and the remaining variables such as density and viscosity are computed using available empirical correlations. The solute concentration in the supercritical carbon dioxide leaving the packed beds of natural products was predicted as a function of extraction time, bed height, solvent flow rate and particle diameter. This model predicts a cumulative yield within an error limit of +6.22\% to −0.42\% for Rosemary leaves, +3.68\% to −3.29\% for Basil leaves and +5.93\% to −4.73\% for Vetiver roots.

We expect that examining this communication can reveal longitudinal patterns in the adoption of sustainable business activities and models. Empirically, we utilize academic and practitioner expert panels to build a set of keywords across nine sustainable business model archetypes and utilize automated content analysis to examine the breadth and nature of a firm's sustainable business activities and practices. We find evidence of the increasing prominence of different types of sustainable business models over time. In particular, the results show that large capitalized firms have mostly adopted the environmentally-oriented archetypes, and to much lesser extent the societal and organizational ones.},

Using design of experiment methodologies an optimised protocol for extraction of medicinal cannabis bud material (population of mixed plants, combined THC:CBD approximately 1:1.5) was developed at a scale of one kg per extraction. Key variables investigated were CO2 flow rate, extraction time and extraction pressure. A total of 15 batches were analysed for process development using a two-level, full factorial design of experiments for three variable factors over eleven batches. The initial eleven batches demonstrated that CO2 flow rate has the most influence on the overall yield and recovery of the key cannabinoids, particularly CBD. The additional four batches were conducted as replicated runs at high flow rates to determine reproducibility. The highest extraction weight of 71\,g (7.1\%) was obtained under high flow rate (150\,g/min), with long extraction time (600\,min) at high pressure (320\,bar). This method also gave the best recoveries of THC and CBD. This is the first study to report the repeated extraction of large amounts of cannabis (total 15\,kg) to optimise the CO2 SFE extraction process for a pharmaceutical product.},

Supercritical fluid extraction is associated with high investment costs; nowadays, an easy method for technical–economical evaluation of supercritical fluid process is not available. Thus, a simple method to estimate the cost of manufacturing of extracts by supercritical fluid technology is presented. The manufacturing costs of clove bud oil and ginger oleoresin were estimated using the procedure proposed. The production of clove bud oil was economically feasible at the quoted extraction condition; its manufacturing cost approximately a fourth of the market price. The manufacturing cost of ginger oleoresin was close to its selling price at the extraction condition considered. This is mainly due to the strong influence of the investment on the cost of manufacturing ginger extracts by supercritical extraction due to the requirement of long extraction times. Nonetheless, some other characteristics of the ginger oleoresin such as the quantity and the availability of gingerols and shogaols should be considered. Additionally, further process parameter studies directed to the increase of the extraction rates should be considered before disregarding the supercritical fluid extraction as a viable process.},

In this study, solvent minimization was done by exploiting the synergistic effect of pH lowering (via in-situ H2CO3 formation) and solvent’s volume expansion (via CO2-expanded solvent) in the extraction of andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata. Conventional solid-liquid extraction (CSLE) and CO2-expanded liquid extraction (CXLE) were conducted using different solvents at a pressure range of 0.1–10\,MPa and 40\,°C in a batch-type extraction vessel to verify both the independent and combined effect of pH and the solvent’s volume expansion coefficient (V/V0) in the extraction recovery. Also, fresh and spent biomass were analyzed using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in order to assess the physical impact of the extraction scheme. The highest andrographolide recovery of 65\% was obtained using CXLE with ethanol and water at pH\,=\,3.02 and V/V0\,=\,4.8, owing to the synergistic effects of the two variables. Furthermore, an increase in extraction recovery with decreasing pH and increasing V/V0 was observed. Moreover, a significant morphological difference between the fresh and spent samples was observed from the results of characterizations, indicating a disruption in the cell wall associated to the expansion of the solvent as it penetrated the plant matrix. The proposed novel extraction strategy allowed a high extraction recovery of andrographolide while complying with sustainable and green practices.},

  abstract = {Solid extraction process, using the supercritical fluid, is a modern science and technology, which has come in vogue regarding its considerable advantages. In the present article, a new and comprehensive model is presented for predicting the performance and separation yield of the supercritical extraction process. The base of process modeling is partial differential mass balances. In the proposed model, the solid particles are considered twofold: (a) particles with intact structure, (b) particles with destructed structure. A distinct mass transfer coefficient has been used for extraction of each part of solid particles to express different extraction regimes and to evaluate the process accurately (internal mass transfer coefficient was used for the intact-structure particles and external mass transfer coefficient was employed for the destructed-structure particles). In order to evaluate and validate the proposed model, the obtained results from simulations were compared with two series of available experimental data for extraction of chamomile extract with supercritical carbon dioxide, which had an excellent agreement. This is indicative of high potentiality of the model in predicting the extraction process, precisely. In the following, the effect of major parameters on supercritical extraction process, like pressure, temperature, supercritical fluid flow rate, and the size of solid particles was evaluated. The model can be used as a superb starting point for scientific and experimental applications.},

The highest extraction yield obtained was 1.42wt\% for the candeia wood and 0.41wt\% for the residue, both at 70°C and 240bar. The Sovová model was used to represent the experimental kinetics of extraction. The major compounds identified in the candeia oil were the sesquiterpenes α-bisabolol, eremanthin and costunolide, and the highest α-bisabolol content (74.45g from 100g of oil) was obtained by the lowest density of the solvent. The highest values for antioxidant activity, determined by the DPPH, FRAP and ABTS methods, were found for oil extracted at 70°C and 240bar.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic propelled many employees into remote work arrangements, and face-to-face meetings were quickly replaced with virtual meetings. This rapid uptick in the use of virtual meetings led to much popular press discussion of virtual meeting fatigue (i.e., “Zoom fatigue”), described as a feeling of being drained and lacking energy following a day of virtual meetings. In this study, we aimed to better understand how one salient feature of virtual meetings—the camera—impacts fatigue, which may affect outcomes during meetings (e.g., participant voice and engagement). We did so through the use of a 4-week within-person experience sampling field experiment where camera use was manipulated. Drawing from theory related to self-presentation, we propose and test a model where study condition (camera on versus off) was linked to daily feelings of fatigue; daily fatigue, in turn, was presumed to relate negatively to voice and engagement during virtual meetings. We further predict that gender and organizational tenure will moderate this relationship such that using a camera during virtual meetings will be more fatiguing for women and newer members of the organization. Results of 1,408 daily observations from 103 employees supported our proposed model, with supplemental analyses suggesting that fatigue affects same-day and next-day meeting performance. Given the anticipated prevalence of remote work even after the pandemic subsides, our study offers key insights for ongoing organizational best practices surrounding virtual meetings.

They are present at high concentrations in the oil and are responsible for the repellent properties of the oil. The oil was extracted using supercritical carbon dioxide due to the high selectivity of the solvent. The operational conditions studied varied from 313.15 to 353.15 K for the temperature and the applied pressures were 6.2, 10.0, 15.0 and 180.0 MPa. Better values of efficiency of the extracted oil were obtained at higher pressure conditions. At constant temperature, the amount of extracted oil increased when the pressure increased, but the opposite occurred when the temperature increased at constant pressure. The composition of the essential oil was complex, although there were several main components in the oil and some waxes were presented in the extracted oils above 10.0 MPa. The results were modeled using a mathematical model in a predictive way, reproducing the extraction curves over the maximum time of the process.}

Different plants including spearmint, rosemary, dill, clary sage, and chamomile were extracted with CO2 in a high pressure apparatus with 5 L extractor vessel volume. The fractionation of extracts was carried out by releasing the separation pressure at two stages. The extracts were separated into essential oil rich “oil” and fatty/waxy products. The extracts were collected as separate samples successively in time. The extraction with carbondioxide was compared to conventional steam distillation (essential oils) and to Soxhlet extraction with hexane (fatty oils). The fatty/waxy products contained the lipophilic substances, including fatty oils, waxes, resins, and colorants. Valuable pharmacological effects are described in the chapter for some minor constituents of these products—triterpenes, diterpenes, sterols, and carotenoids. Thin layer chromatography and on-line ultraviolet–visible (UV–VIS) spectroscopy are used for the quick identification and quantity determination of these compounds using authentic samples as standards. The SFE method proves favorable in terms of both extraction yield and speed of carotenoids.},

Design of experiments and process optimization was carried out with response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD). Influence of operating parameters including pressure (P=100–220bar), temperature (T=308–328K), particle size (dp=0.3–0.9mm) and dynamic extraction time (t=30–150min) on final response was evaluated. The experimental values were adequately fitted to a quadratic polynomial equation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that all factors were significantly affected the extraction yield of essential oil from C. coluteoides. Using a grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, the optimal operating conditions were determined to be P=220bar, T=308K, dp=0.58mm and t=135min, under which conditions, the maximum yield of 0.6589 was obtained. Chemical compositions extracted by hydro-distillation (HD) and SC-CO2 methods were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and determined by GC/FID. Comparing the two methods, the obtained results showed higher total extraction yield with SC-CO2 technique.},

  abstract = {This article presents experimental results and mathematical modeling predictions of the extraction of essential oil from Eryngium billardieri, for the first time, using supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) method. Design of experiments and experimental optimization were carried out with a response surface methodology (RSM) to investigate the effects of different operating parameters including pressure (100–300bar), temperature (308–328K), particle size (0.45–1.05mm) and extraction time (30–150min). The maximum extraction yield was found to be 0.8522\% w/w at the optimum conditions 300bar, 308K, 0.75mm and 130min. Moreover, in order to describe the kinetic behavior of extraction process, a mathematical model based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory of adsorption with three adjustable parameters was developed for correlating experimental data. Model parameters have been optimized by applying simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The obtained results from model predictions were consistent with experimental data in the different extraction conditions.},

  abstract = {Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) was used to extract components of interest from Scenedesmus dimorphus, a microalgae species, under varied algal harvesting and extraction conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the concentration of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and the FAME profile of transesterified lipids, phospholipids and pigments extracted under varied supercritical temperatures and pressures. The scCO2 extraction results are compared with conventional solvent extraction to evaluate differences in the efficiency and nature of the extracted materials. Algae harvested by centrifugation (vs.lyophilization) demonstrated a similar extraction efficiency in scCO2, indicating potential energy benefits by avoiding conventional algal mass dehydration prior to extraction. Centrifuged algae and optimized extraction conditions (6000 psi; 100 °C) resulted in comparable FAME yields to conventional processes, as well as increased selectivity, reflected in the decreased pigment, nitrogen and phospholipid contamination of the FAME. Cell pre-treatments—sonication, microwave, bead beating and lyophilization—showed an enhancement in extraction yield in both conventional solvent and scCO2 extraction, allowing for improved extraction efficiencies. This study suggests that scCO2, a green solvent, shows great potential for algal lipid extraction for the sustainable production of biodiesel.},

A kinetics model with variable mass transfer coefficients proposed to describe supercritical fluid extraction of grape and almond seed oil. Threedistinctstages are found for extraction process, i.e., fast-extraction, slow-extraction, transition period, with a very short overflowoil in first stage. The overflow oil period is so short and the concentration variation is so slight that we think this period belongs to the fast-extraction stage. Theoretical predictions for yield distributions of supercritical fluid extractionare highly in agreement with the experimental data in literatures, which implies that the proposed model can be used to predict more mechanism for the extraction process. Moreover,the effects of involved parameters on mass transport and supercritical extraction process are shown graphically and analyzed.},

For the purpose of modeling, the waxes are represented by n-tritriacontane and furanocoumarins – by xanthotoxin, the solubility of which in CO2 was measured using the dynamic method. A rigorous thermodynamic modeling framework was applied to calculate the composition-dependent solubilities of extracted compounds, which were incorporated in the kinetics model in order to calculate the extraction curves. For individual extraction curves, the average absolute deviation between the calculated and experimental extraction yields, expressed as percentage of the asymptotic extraction yield, was in the range (0.2–5.8) \%.},

Extraction rate was measured as a function of temperature, flow rate and particle size. Based on results from spiked beds, mathematical models were proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of extraction from carrots. The validity of a diffusion model or a mass balance model was discussed through results on particle size. Although the diffusion model and the experimental results were in good agreement, provided that two stages of diffusion were considered for larger particle size, we further analyzed all data regarding a differential mass balance model. This model, accounting for external mass transfer, diffusion within the matrix and dissolution at the solid/fluid interface, described the time-dependent process satisfactorily despite assumptions on the matrix description. Results showed that both external mass transfer and desorption of solute from the matrix were the limiting steps.},

The starting point was a previous study on the same subject, which considered that no solute is lost in the vapor phase and a fixed fraction of 2\% of the CO2 is lost within the heavy phase. The flash separation step was simulated using the SuperPro Designs 6.0® Software, which calculates the phase equilibrium that occurs during the separation step using the Peng–Robinson equation of state. Experimental data for extraction kinetics from vetiver grass were obtained at 313K and 20MPa. Phase equilibria for CO2/vetiver extract were measured at pressures from 7.5 to 30MPa and temperatures of 303.2, 318.2 and 333.2K; CO2 weight fraction varied from 0.1 to 0.99. The flash tank experimental data was obtained for fennel at 4MPa and 293K; the resulting anethole loss was 1.45\%. The costs of manufacturing (COM) of the SFE extracts were determined according to Turton et al. using Tecanalysis v 1.0; the influence of the non-ideal flash separation step on COM was studied for clove buds.},

The other books in the series are~Fooled by Randomness,~The Black Swan, Skin in the Game,~and~The Bed of Procrustes.Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the bestselling author of The Black Swan and one of the foremost thinkers of our time, reveals how to thrive in an uncertain world. Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, and rumors or riots intensify when someone tries to repress them, many things in life benefit from stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.~  In The Black Swan, Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In Antifragile, Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.  Furthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call “efficient” not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the Titanic save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear. Antifragile is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world. Erudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb’s message is revolutionary: The antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.Praise for Antifragile“Ambitious and thought-provoking . . . highly entertaining.”—The Economist “A bold book explaining how and why we should embrace uncertainty, randomness, and error . . . It may just change our lives.”—Newsweek},

  abstract = {In recent years, consumers have developed an ever-increasing interest in natural products as alternatives for artificial additives or pharmacologically relevant agents. Among them, essential oils have gained great popularity in the food, cosmetic, as well as the pharmaceutical industries. Constituting an array of many lipophilic and highly volatile components derived from a great range of different chemical classes, essential oils are known to be susceptible to conversion and degradation reactions. Oxidative and polymerization processes may result in a loss of quality and pharmacological properties. Despite their relevance for consumers, there is a paucity of information available addressing this issue. Therefore, the present review provides a comprehensive summary on possible changes in essential oils and factors affecting their stability. Focusing on individual essential oils, the various paths of degradation upon exposure to extrinsic parameters are outlined. Especially temperature, light, and oxygen availability are recognized to have a crucial impact on essential oil integrity. Finally, analytical methods to assess both genuine as well as altered essential oil profiles are evaluated with respect to their suitability to track chemical alterations. It is believed that only a careful inspection of essential oils by a set of convenient methods allows profound quality assessment that is relevant to producers and consumers alike.},

We measured the internal and external pressures of a CO2 bubble covered with a rubber membrane using pressure transducers, and observed the bubble's oscillations by a high-speed video camera. We evaluated the maximum duration of the scCO2 for conditions 60μs in experiments. We performed numerical simulations using the Rayleigh–Plesset equation by substituting the experimental external pressure profiles of the bubble and confirmed that numerical results agreed with the experimental internal pressure. Moreover, in the minimum external pressure condition where we experimentally achieved the condition of scCO2 in the bubble for 16μs by water hammer, we obtained the maximum duration of scCO2 conditions up to 55μs by numerical simulations assuming isotropic compression.},

  abstract = {A new methodology for the selective isolation of varietal total hop essential oil from hop pellets and further chromatographic fractionation of total hop oil into terpeneless polar hop essence, is presented. The methodology is essentially based on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of total hop essential oil using carbon dioxide of appropriate density, followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) using octadecylsilica and ethanol/water mixtures for preparation of polar hop essence. Different SFE temperature–pressure combinations were tested for extraction of total hop essential oil from pellets. A carbon dioxide density of 0.50g/mL (50°C, 110atm), proved to be the best compromise in view of selective and quantitative extraction of total hop essential oils. Further fractionation of total hop essential oil by SPE in order to remove hydrocarbons, resulted in varietal polar hop essence, highly enriched in water-soluble, oxygenated hop oil constituents. All of the applied procedures of the proposed SFE/SPE methodology are in full accordance with the principles of clean-label technology. As a result, the novel hop aroma products are fully compatible with the beer matrix. When added to beer, the novel hop oil preparations impart a typical, varietal dependant pleasant hoppy character and increase beer bitterness and mouthfeel.},

The reliability of the method is evaluated by predicting the vapor pressure data of nearly 50 compounds which are representative of several classes of compounds, including strongly polar molecules and bifunctional compounds. A comparison is made with some well-known literature predictive relations. As a by-product, the new method gives the enthalpy of vaporization of pure compounds in the temperature range below Tb.},

The purpose was to develop an effective extraction condition for the removal of eight target monoterpenes from Australian tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia Cheel) leaves. The optimum conditions for extraction were found to be 0.25 g/mL scCO2 density at a chamber temperature of 110oC. These condition were most effective when applied to whole fresh and rehydrated whole dried leaves, where it yielded maximum recovery of target analytes with minimum change in oil composition for the extractor system employed. This study demonstrates the importance of the type of sample matrix used in SFE work, and that a different extraction protocol would need to be developed for each matrix.},

  abstract = {To improve essential oil quality, especially to reserve the thermal instability of compounds, supercritical CO2 extraction (SFE) was applied to recover essential oil from Cymbopogon citronella leaves. A response surface methodology was applied to optimize the extraction process. The highest essential oil yield was predicted at extraction time 120\,\,min, extraction pressure 25\,\,MPa, extraction temperature 35°C, and CO2 flow 18\,\,L/h for the SFE processing. Under these experimental conditions, the mean essential oil yield is 4.40\%. In addition, the chemical compositions of SFE were compared with those obtained by hydrodistillation extraction (HD). There were 41 compounds obtained of SFE, while 35 compounds of HD. Alcohols and aldehydes were the main compositions in the essential oils. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities and antimicrobial of essential oils obtained by HD and the evaluated condition of SFE were compared. Results showed that the antioxidant activities of SFE oil are better than those of HD. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the microdilution method. Essential oil obtained from SFE and HD exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms. It is confirmed that the SFE method can be an alternative processing method to extract essential oils from Cymbopogon citronella leaves.},

We obtain the power-law reaction rate coefficient, and by numerical analyses we show a very strong dependence of the rate coefficient on the power-law parameter. We find that the power-law collision theory can successfully overcome the two difficulties of the Lindemann–Christiansen mechanism. We take three reactions as examples to calculate the new pre-exponential factor and yield the values that can be exactly in agreement with those measured in the experimental studies.},
