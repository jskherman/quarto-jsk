- `2022-09-26` I am currently reading through the Mushoku Tensei Light Novel Series. I am now at [volume 18](https://g.co/kgs/SS4fm1) of the official English-translated light novels.

- `2022-08-15` The start of the 1st semester of academic year 2022â€“2023, and the 1st semester of my 4th year studying Chemical Engineering. It seems like things are ramping up and everyone seems eager for the face-to-face hybrid classes.
