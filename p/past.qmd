## 2021â€“2029

### The Year 2022

### The Year 2021

#### June

- `2021-06-21`: Learned the ins and outs of being a Vice President for Internal Affairs in my university's student organization for the Chemical Engineering department: [Philippine Institute of Chemical Engineering - Junior Chapter V (PIChE-JCV)](https://www.facebook.com/PIChEJCV/).

- `2021-06-26`: Developed this website and the [other site](https://notes.jskherman.com) for my notes. I have learned a lot about the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/) and the world of [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) on the side, little by little, throughout last year.
